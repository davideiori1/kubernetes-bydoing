# kubernetes-bydoing

This project aims to describe everything I did to learn Kubernetes, by doing. Someone told me that the best way to learn something is to install it: that's what we are going to do here, i.e. install Kubernetes into different platforms. I decided not to go with plain Kubernetes but use an enterprise-grade version of it, OKD that is a distribution of Kubernetes optimized for continuous application development and multi-tenant deployment. OKD also serves as the upstream code base upon which Red Hat OpenShift Online and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform are builtOpenshift Container Platform (OCP).
